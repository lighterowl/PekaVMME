# PekaVMME : a Java Micro Edition client for Peka Virtual Monitor

This repository contains an implementation of a J2ME midlet meant to display the
data provided by the Peka Virtual Monitor.

It is probably far from finished, but the basic functionality works alright.

I haven't tested this on a real device, as my Motorola WX308 apparently refuses
to run unsigned JARs which want to have Internet access.

I used NetBeans 7.3 with Java 1.6.0_45 to build this. You will also need the
Java Micro Edition Platform SDK, version 3.0.5.
